# Iot Data Extraction Research

Abstract:  

The Internet of things(IoT) is a growing nowadays especially with the rise of smart products. For example, the merging of IT and OT(Operational Technology) where sensors, actuators and so on remove the barriers between these commonly disconnected worlds. Many of todayâ€™s methods of inspecting structures are very time consuming , labour intensive and in many cases impractical. Moreover, with continuing approach in signal processing and communications a  hugesignificant interest has been shown in developing new diagnostic technologies for monitoring the integrity of structures with known defects, or for detecting new defects, in real time with minimum human involvement. Based on preervious scholar articles, the main goal of Acoustic Emission examinations in industrial applications today are detection and assessment of flaws in structures made of metal. Through the VIP research, I hope to be able efforts will be made to detect anomalies within the edge tool of acoustic emission techniques as well as to be to doperform full data extraction and analysis from the signals coming from the acoustic emission machine.
